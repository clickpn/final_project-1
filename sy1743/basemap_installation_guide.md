## Installation
basemap and GEOS (Geometry Engine - Open Source) library are required for showing features on the map, both two libraries are already downloaded in the compressed file: **basemap-1.0.7.tar.gz**.
The below instructions are referenced from:              http://matplotlib.org/basemap/users/installing.html
### step 1: Numpy, python and matplotlib
Install numpy 1.0.0 or later, python 2.4 or later, matplotlib 1.0.0 or later. **If they are installed, go to step2**.
### step 2: Untar the file
Untar the basemap-1.0.7.tar.gz file in the folder **resource**, and and cd to the **basemap-1.0.7** directory
### step 3: Install GEOS library
**1 If you donâ€™t have GEOS library on your system**, you can build it from the source code included with basemap by using following commands in the ubuntu command line:
* cd to the geos-3.3.3 directory (it is under the directory basemap-1.0.7)
```sh
$ cd geos-3.3.3
```
* setting environment variable GEOS_DIR and Install the GEOS library
```sh
$ export GEOS_DIR=<the directory you want the libs and headers to go> 
##I recommend to install it in your home directory, for example:/home/ds-ga-1007
##Do not have space before and after the '=' symbol, a correct example is like this: export GEOS_DIR=/home/ds-ga-1007
##If any permission wrong happens, use sudo su to get the super user authority, or get root authority

$ ./configure --prefix=$GEOS_DIR
##I recommend you to get super user authority here
##The result of this command is like: 
##Swig: false 
##Python bindings: false
##...

$ sudo su ##then enter the password to get super user authority
$ make; make install ## It may take a bit time, ignore the warnings if any
```

**2 If you already have GEOS library on your system**, just set the environment variable GEOS_DIR to point to the location of libgeos_c and geos_c.h (if libgeos_c is in /usr/local/lib and geos_c.h is in /usr/local/include, set GEOS_DIR to /usr/local). Then go to next step. 

### step 4: Install basemap
cd back to the top level basemap directory (**basemap-1.0.7**) and run the usual **python setup.py install**. Check your installation by running **from mpl_toolkits.basemap import Basemap** at the python prompt.
```sh
$ cd basemap-1.0.7
#make sure you have super user authority 
$ sudo su
$ python setup.py install

##Check whether you have installed successfully
$ python
$ from mpl_toolkits.basemap import Basemap 
##If this works, the installation is OK
```





# Dillinger

Dillinger is a cloud-enabled, mobile-ready, offline-storage, AngularJS powered HTML5 Markdown editor.

  - Type some Markdown on the left
  - See HTML in the right
  - Magic

Markdown is a lightweight markup language based on the formatting conventions that people naturally use in email.  As [John Gruber] writes on the [Markdown site][df1]

> The overriding design goal for Markdown's
> formatting syntax is to make it as readable
> as possible. The idea is that a
> Markdown-formatted document should be
> publishable as-is, as plain text, without
> looking like it's been marked up with tags
> or formatting instructions.

This text you see here is *actually* written in Markdown! To get a feel for Markdown's syntax, type some text into the left window and watch the results in the right.

### Version
3.2.0

### Tech

Dillinger uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [AngularJS] - HTML enhanced for web apps!
* [Ace Editor] - awesome web-based text editor
* [Marked] - a super fast port of Markdown to JavaScript
* [Twitter Bootstrap] - great UI boilerplate for modern web apps
* [node.js] - evented I/O for the backend
* [Express] - fast node.js network app framework [@tjholowaychuk]
* [Gulp] - the streaming build system
* [keymaster.js] - awesome keyboard handler lib by [@thomasfuchs]
* [jQuery] - duh

And of course Dillinger itself is open source with a [public repository][dill]
 on GitHub.

### Installation

You need Gulp installed globally:

```sh
$ npm i -g gulp
```

```sh
$ git clone [git-repo-url] dillinger
$ cd dillinger
$ npm i -d
$ mkdir -p downloads/files/{md,html,pdf}
$ gulp build --prod
$ NODE_ENV=production node app
```

### Plugins

Dillinger is currently extended with the following plugins

* Dropbox
* Github
